## 🏆 Why Our Project Excels


- **Fully Local & Private RAG (No APIs):** Unlike projects relying on paid APIs (OpenAI/GPT-4), we run a quantized **TinyLlama-1.1B** LLM and **ChromaDB** vector store entirely locally. This demonstrates advanced resource management and ensures complete data privacy.

- **Complex CV + NLP Pipeline:** We don't just serve a simple Scikit-learn model. We deploy a heavy **PyTorch** Computer Vision model alongside an LLM, integrating multiple deep learning modalities into a single inference engine.

- **Heavy Resource Management:** Our container is **5GB+** in size and requires **4GB+ RAM** to serve the CV and RAG models simultaneously. We deployed to **Azure** specifically because standard free-tier compute instances (often limited to 1GB RAM) were insufficient for this high-performance workload.

- **Production-Grade Frontend:** Moved beyond prototyping tools like Streamlit or Gradio. We built a responsive, animated **Next.js (React)** application with a polished chat interface, demonstrating full-stack engineering capabilities.

- **Custom-Built Knowledge Base:** We curated our own RAG corpus by scraping **322+ websites** covering all 38 plant disease classes, ensuring our chatbot provides domain-specific, accurate medical advice.

- **Dual CI/CD Pipelines:** Implemented specialized workflows:
    1.  **Frontend:** Instant deployments to **Vercel**.
    2.  **Backend:** Robust Docker build-and-push pipeline to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**, handling heavy artifacts that exceed standard free-tier limits.

## 💻 Local Setup Guide

Follow these steps to run the entire application (Backend + Frontend) locally on your machine.

### 1. Backend Setup (Docker)
Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running.

```bash
# Build and start the backend services (API, Prometheus, Grafana)
docker-compose up --build
```
*The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.*

### 2. Frontend Setup (Next.js)
Open a new terminal window.

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
*The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.*

### 3. Environment Configuration
For optimal local performance, ensure your frontend is pointing to your local backend.

1.  Open `frontend/.env.local`.
2.  Update the variables to use the local proxy:

```dotenv
# frontend/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api/proxy
BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
*This configuration routes requests through the Next.js proxy (avoiding CORS) and points them to your local Docker container.*

### 🔄 ML Workflow & Service Interaction
The system integrates multiple MLOps services to ensure a robust lifecycle from data to inference.

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   **CV Data:** PlantVillage dataset is loaded and augmented (random crops, flips) using `torchvision`.
    *   **RAG Data:** Scraped agricultural text is chunked and embedded using `sentence-transformers`.
2.  **Training & Tracking (MLflow):**
    *   **CV Model:** The Swin Transformer training is tracked via **MLflow** (hosted locally on port 5000). It logs hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size), metrics (loss, accuracy), and artifacts (ONNX models).
    *   **RAG Pipeline:** Ingestion parameters and vector store statistics are also logged to MLflow for reproducibility.
3.  **Inference:**
    *   The **FastAPI** backend loads the optimized ONNX model and ChromaDB vector store.
    *   **Prometheus** scrapes real-time inference metrics (latency, request count) from the API.
    *   **Evidently AI** monitors the input data for drift against the training baseline.

### 1. Computer Vision Model for Plant Diseases
We trained a **Swin Transformer** (`microsoft/swin-tiny-patch4-window7-224`) on the **PlantVillage** dataset to classify 38 distinct plant disease classes.
- **Framework:** Hugging Face Transformers & PyTorch
- **Training Strategy:**
    - **Augmentation:** Random resized crops, horizontal flips, 15° rotations, and color jitter.
    - **Optimization:** AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of `2e-5` and batch size of 32.
    - **Tracking:** Full experiment tracking via **MLflow** (loss, accuracy, artifacts).
- **Performance:** Achieved high accuracy on the validation set with Early Stopping (patience=3).

### 2. RAG Pipeline (Knowledge Retrieval)
We built a hybrid retrieval system to ground LLM responses in factual agricultural data.
- **Ingestion:**
    - **Source:** Custom JSON dataset scraped from 322+ agricultural websites.
    - **Chunking:** `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (Chunk size: 800, Overlap: 100).
    - **Embeddings:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
- **Vector Store:** **ChromaDB** (Persistent local storage).
- **Hybrid Retrieval:**
    - Combines **BM25 (Sparse)** for exact keyword matching (weight: 0.4).
    - Combines **Chroma (Dense)** for semantic search (weight: 0.6).
    - **Ensemble Retriever:** Merges results to ensure both specific terminology and general context are captured.
 
 ### 🛠️ Step-by-Step RAG Deployment Guide
To deploy the RAG pipeline locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Prepare the Corpus:**
    Ensure your scraped data is in `Web_Scrapping_For_Corpus/sample.json`.
2.  **Run Ingestion:**
    Execute the ingestion script to chunk text and build the ChromaDB vector store.
    ```bash
    python backend/ingest.py
    ```
    *This creates the `backend/models/flora_rag_db` directory.*
3.  **Verify Database:**
    Check that the vector store is populated.
    ```bash
    ls backend/models/flora_rag_db
    ```
4.  **Start the API:**
    Launch the FastAPI server which loads the RAG retriever.
    ```bash
    uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
    ```

## 🧪 MLflow Experiment Tracking
We use **MLflow** to track all experiments locally.

**Launch the Dashboard:**
```bash
# View Model Training Experiments (Port 5000)
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri ./mlruns/mlruns_training --port 5000
```
*Access at: `http://localhost:5000`*

**Service Interaction:**
*   **Training Scripts:** `pipeline.py` logs metrics directly to the local MLflow tracking URI.
*   **Artifact Store:** Models and vector stores are saved as artifacts within MLflow runs for version control.
*   **Comparison:** We use the MLflow UI to compare different prompt strategies (Zero-shot vs Few-shot) and CV model checkpoints.

## ❓ FAQ & Troubleshooting

### General Questions
**Q: What is the primary goal of Fluora Care?**
> **A:** To provide an offline-capable, privacy-focused tool for farmers to diagnose plant diseases using computer vision and receive treatment advice via a specialized chatbot.

**Q: Why use a local LLM (TinyLlama) instead of OpenAI?**
> **A:** We prioritize data privacy and cost-efficiency. Running locally ensures no sensitive agricultural data leaves the device and eliminates API usage fees.

**Q: Is an internet connection required?**
> **A:** No. Once the Docker container is built and models are downloaded, the entire inference pipeline (CV + Chat) runs completely offline.

### Technical Troubleshooting

**Q: The Docker container exits immediately with code 137?**
> **A:** This usually means Out Of Memory (OOM). Ensure your Docker Desktop has at least **4GB RAM** allocated.

**Q: I see "ONNX Model missing" in the logs?**
> **A:** You need to download the model artifacts. Run `python backend/download_models.py` (if available) or ensure `backend/models/flora_cv_onnx/` contains `model.onnx`.

**Q: How do I run this on Windows?**
> **A:** We recommend using **WSL2** or **Git Bash**. The `Makefile` commands might need adjustment for PowerShell.
