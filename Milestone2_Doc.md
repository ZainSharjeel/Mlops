##  D4: LLM Evaluation & Monitoring
**Goal:** Operational visibility and data drift.

| Status | Task / Requirement | Artifact Location | Notes / Implementation Details |
| :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | Track Metrics via Prometheus | Prometheus Config | Prometheus configured to scrape LLM API metrics. Tracks request rates and latency. |
| ✅ | Visualize in Grafana | Grafana Dashboard | Dashboard operational at `localhost:3000`. Visualizes `http_requests_total` and response times. Query: `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`. |
